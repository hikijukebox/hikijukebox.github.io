Hello, my name is hiki--an INFJ, a web dev hobbyist, an analog photographer, a postcrosser, and a person who struggling with *Major Depressive Disorder*.

I like experimenting something random with my laptop, watching anime and documentaries, reading manga or novel, sending postcard through [Postcrossing](https://www.postcrossing.com/), collecting stamps (used or new), listening music, analog photography, and drawing. This blog mostly written in Indonesian but sometimes I write in English or Japanese. Since I'm not an English and Japanese speaker, please expect some grammatical errors or spelling errors from my blog posts.

I'm not really that good at writing. What I'll do in this blog is just blabbering around. You may read some review about books, musics, places or photos I recently found, *haiku*, my rant, opinion or thoughts, and just a bit of fandom things I really into, like manga, anime, idol, or light novel.

I think that's enough for introduction.

Thanks for dropping by and taking the time to read this. Take care and have a nice day!
